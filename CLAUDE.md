# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **SRE Challenge** - 

### Part 1: Cluster Setup
- **Provision a Kubernetes Cluster:** Set up a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube, Kind,
or any cloud provider like AWS EKS, Google GKE, or Azure AKS. Make sure to do this
using Terraform (no restrictions on providers).
- **Ensure Cluster Security:** Apply best practices for Kubernetes security (e.g., use
RBAC, Network Policies, and Pod Security Policies).

### Part 2: Install Flux
- **Install Flux on the Cluster:** Use Terraform to bootstrap the Kubernetes cluster to
your repository.
- **Configure Repository:** Initialize a new Git repository with configurations and
Kubernetes manifests that Flux will synchronize.
- **Verify Installation:** Ensure that Flux is properly managing the resources in your
Kubernetes cluster by pushing a change to your repository and observing that Flux
applies the change.

### Part 3: Application Deployment
- **Prepare Application Manifests:** Create Kubernetes manifests for a simple web
application (you can use a sample image like `nginx` or `httpd` or `echo`).
- **Deploy Using Flux:** Commit these manifests to your Git repository in a structured
directory (e.g., `staging` and `production` environments).
- **Implement Automated Rollbacks:** Configure Flux to automatically rollback
deployments if they fail health checks and also to automatically upgrade the app version
on patch/bugfix increment.

### Part 4: Monitoring and Logging
- **Set up Monitoring Tools:** Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring your
Kubernetes resources. You can use whatever monitoring stack you are most
comfortable, no need to add alerting and custom integrations, just the basics.
- **Configure Logging:** Use Fluentd or a similar log extraction/aggregation tool of your
choice to aggregate logs from the Kubernetes nodes and pods.

### Part 5: Documentation
- **Document Your Setup:** Provide a README.md in your repository detailing the steps
you took, issues faced, and how you resolved them. Include screenshots or diagrams
where applicable.

## Best Practices and Bonus Points Criteria
- **Code Quality:** Clear, maintainable code with comments. A full
destruction/creation of the cluster without manual steps is a good example.
- **Security:** Adherence to security best practices throughout the setup. Bonus points
for using a VM with a CIS compliant base image.
- **Scalability:** Demonstrate how your setup can scale e∆Øiciently based on CPU.
- **Resilience:** Implement fault-tolerance and automatic rollback capabilities.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation that explains your process and
choices.
